# The Fragment Puzzler: Reassembling Cloud Data Shards (Image)                                           
## Mission:              
Cloud storage breaks files into tiny 'shards' for efficiency. This system analyzes thousands of mixed-up data fragments and figures out which piece fits where, like a digital jigsaw puzzle.                      
## MVP Requirements:              
* Fragment Analysis: Recognize distinct visual edges on each data block
* Automated Solver: Algorithm that matches edges like puzzle solver
* Visual verification: Rebuild image to prove data integrity restored
## *Our Approach:*     
The images uploaded on cloud are stored in the form of _shards_. To reassemble the fragments into
